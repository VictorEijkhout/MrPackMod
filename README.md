# MrPackMod: Package installer with LMod integration

Usage:
``` 
mpm.py [ -c Configuration ] [ -t ] keywords
```
where keywords: `test download unpack configure build module`, 
or `install` for `configure build module`.
This can download, configure, install a package, 
and generate LMod modules.

## Configuration file

By default, `mpm` looks for a file `Configuration`, but the `-c` option
allows you to specify another name.
The configuration file contains lines:
```
# comment
key = value
let keymacro = value
```
Typical keys are
```
PACKAGE = somepackage
let PACKAGEVERSION = 1.0.0
ABOUT = This package is for something
BUILDSYSTEM = cmake
CMAKEFLAGS = \
 -D FOO=ON \
 -D BAR=OFF
DOWNLOADURL = https://github.com/SomePackage/v${PACKAGEVERSION}.tar.gz
```
The `let` keyword indicates a macro, which can be used in other settings,
such as here the download link.

## Environment

The MrPackMod system relies on a couple of environment variables:
- `TACC_SYSTEM` : this is used for path generation in case you have multiple systems on a shared file system
- `TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER `, `TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER_VERSION`, `TACC_FAMILY_MPI`, `TACC_FAMILY_MPI_VERSION` : these are mostly used for module path generation
Certain environment variables can be overriden:
- `PACKAGEROOT` : packages are downloaded and unpacked in `${PACKAGEROOT}/${PACKAGENAME}`; override this with the `DOWNLOADPATH` setting.
  The packageroot is also used as the default location of any builddirectory; override this with `BUILDDIRROOT`. (!!!not yet implemented!!!)
- `INSTALLROOT` : the package is installed in `${INSTALLROOT}/installation-${PACKAGE}-${EXTENSION}` where the extension is compound of system, compiler, mpi.
  Override this whole path with `INSTALLPATH`.
- `MODULEROOT` : this is used to build up the `${MODULEROOT}/{Core,Compiler,MPI}/et/cetera` path as in the LMod documentation.
  Override the whole of this path with `MODULEDIRSET` (!!!not yet implemented!!!)

## Downloading

The `DOWNLOADURL` setting is used in the `download` action. It supports `tgz`, `tar.gz`, `xz`, and `zip` extensions. 
(!!!add bz2!!!)
This URL typically contains the compulsory `PACKAGEVERSION` setting.

A subsequent `unpack` action unpacks the downloaded file and renames the result to a standard naming scheme of
`${PACKAGE}-${PACKAGEVERSION}`.
(!!!not yet: the `retar` action then packs up the unpacked and renamed bundle to `${PACKAGE}-${PACKAGEVERSION}.tgz`. This is useful in an `rpmbuild` context.!!!)

(!!!not yet: there is a `GITREPO` setting and corresponding `clone` action!!!)

## Configure

The `BUILDSYSTEM` setting can be `cmake` or `autotools`.
Correspondingly, the `CMAKEFLAGS` and `CONFIGUREFLAGS` settings are used.
- CMake uses a number of default flags such as:
  - `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`. Override this with `CMAKEBUILDTYPE`.
  - `-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`. Override this with a nonzero value for `BUILDSTATICLIBS`.
- Autotools looks for `configure`, `configure.ac`, `autogen.sh` and treats them accordingly. Further settings:
  - `CONFIGURESUBDIR` indicates that the configure script is in a subdirectory;
  - By default an option `--prefix=/install/dir` is used.
    If your package uses `-prefix` or so (pdtoolkit), specify `PREFIXOPTION = -prefix` and such.

CMake will do the configuration in a builddirectory that is created alongside the source directory.
Override this with the `BUILDDIRROOT` setting.
Autotools will do the configuration in the source directory; 
packages that support a separate builddirectory can use the `CONFIGINBUILDDIR` setting.

## Building

After configuration, `make && make install` is done in the builddirectory, for which see the previous point.
The `make` is parallel, using the `JCOUNT` setting.
A target can be specified with `MAKEBUILDTARGET` (enzo).
The setting `EXTRABUILDTARGETS` is used in a second `make` call (sqlite).

## Module

Prerequisite modules are given as
```
MODULES = zlib hdf5
```
where optionally version numbers can be attached: `hdf5/<2` or `hdf5/1.>12`.
The `configure` and `build` actions tests for these modules to be loaded.

### Module file

An LMod module file `${MODULENAME}/${PACKAGEVERSION}.lua` is generated on an automatically generated path, depending on the `MODE` setting:
- `core` : `${MODULEROOT}/Core`.
- `seq` or `omp` : `${MODULEROOT}/Compiler/${TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER}/${TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER_VERSION}`
- `mpi` or `hybrid` : `${MODULEROOT}/MPI/${TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER}/${TACC_FAMILY_COMPILER_VERSION}/${TACC_MPI_FAMILY}/${TACC_MPI_FAMILY_VERSION}`

Here `MODULENAME` is `PACKAGE`, unless the setting `MODULENAME` is explicitly used;
see for instance `MODULENAME = phdf5` for the parallel version of `PACKAGE = hdf5`.

Alternatively, use `MODULEDIRSET` for a fully explicit path.

### Lib,Inc,Bin and such

By default, the module will have variables for an include and lib directory.
- If there is not include dir, set `NOINC = 1`;
- If there is no lib dir, set `NOLIB = 1`;
- If there is a bin dir, set `HASBIN = 1`.

The `INCLUDE`, `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variables are updated accordingly.

The settings `PYTHONPATHABS`, `PYTHONPATHREL` update the `PYTHONPATH` 
variable with an absolute path, and a path relative to the installation respectively.

### Discoverability

If the package generates `.cmake` files, specify `PREFIXPATHSET = 1`.
If the package generates `.pc` files, specify 
- `PKGCONFIG = path` for a path relative to the installation, or
- `PKGCONFIGLIB = path` for a path relative to the lib directory.

### More

More settings:
- `ABOUT` is a compulsory one-line description of the package;
- `URL`, `SOFTWAREURL` are URLs for homepage and software page;
- `DEPENDSON = package` : inserts a `depends_on( "package" )` line;
- `DEPENDSONCURRENT = package` generates a `depends_on` clause that additionally includes the version number of the currently loaded package.
